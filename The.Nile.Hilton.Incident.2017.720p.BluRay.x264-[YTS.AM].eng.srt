13
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:28,021
We worked harder because we built Egypt.

14
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,484
That time is over. The big
task is now complete.

15
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:37,739
Today, we are asked to
take care of our children.

16
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:43,203
From the highest levels of the government,
education has become a priority.

17
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,542
But ordinary Egyptians are unable
to provide for their children,

18
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,131
the values, education and
perspective required.

19
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:57,843
Can we truly educate our children?
I say no.

20
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,534
Where were you, you moron?

21
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,412
The satellite dish repair
guy made me wait 3 hours.

22
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,997
You had to wait for him?

23
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:30,042
I didn't wait out the whole day, I swear.

24
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,587
These big companies, you can't trust them.

25
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,548
Saleh, I didn't ask you to free Jerusalem.

26
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,259
You had to just open the door.

27
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,677
OK sir.

28
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,055
OK? What does that mean, OK?

29
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:47,225
My cousin can fix that for you.

30
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,604
Get a genie out of a lamp if
you must, but get it done.

31
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:52,689
Be careful.

32
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,909
Takes long to load.

33
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,246
Look, Chief.

34
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,957
Here you put your interests.

35
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,753
You like to read, write, play football...

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Write it here.

37
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,301
And here you put your pictures.

38
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,095
Photos taken by you

39
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,765
or that of your friends posted on Facebook.

40
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,769
And here you have your friends.

41
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,272
All these are my friends.

42
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,609
Full of strangers, especially girls.

43
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,986
Look at this one.

44
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,531
I will meet her.

45
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:45,450
She looks like a pink baby elephant!

46
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:46,617
I know.

47
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,955
She just liked my picture.

48
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,222
What?

49
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:52,225
She put a "Like".

50
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,336
We "Like" pictures of our
friends and they "Like" ours.

51
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,880
That means she likes my picture.

52
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,592
Come on, Casanova, back to work.

53
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,400
What did you talk to Mr.Kammal about?

54
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,360
That you're welcome.

55
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,155
And you could come any day.

56
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,739
Lets go with that.

57
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:39,754
Good evening, Chef.

58
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,425
We sell nothing anymore. Mr.Walid
allowed the Chinese to sell.

59
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,761
Don't tell us about your life.
Where's our share?

60
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:51,349
Business is bad.
Listen. I want my money.

61
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,851
I'll tell the boss.

62
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:13,788
Do you work with the Chinese?
Mr.Kammal agreed prior.

63
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,874
Did you transact behind my back?

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Never, Chief.

65
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,792
Go.

66
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,048
Chief? Chief?

67
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:24,966
A word? A word.

68
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:28,512
They don't respect us anymore.

69
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:19,020
Now here's our Supreme Commander,

70
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:23,692
President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak.

71
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:27,946
Thank you.

72
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,497
I congratulate the Police for
capturing the terrorists

73
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,501
who perpetrated the attack on Alexandria.

74
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:56,433
As we prepare to celebrate Police Day,

75
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,562
Egypt suffers yet another terrorist attack.

76
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:06,401
You just heard the Minister
of the Interior...

77
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,609
I sacrificed everything for you!
You promised me!

78
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:52,072
Bastard!

79
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,865
Get out!

80
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,118
Go away! Bastard!

81
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,581
Yes, sir.

82
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,460
Very well, sir.

83
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,378
Good bye, sir.

84
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:18,092
Captain?

85
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,386
I was observing the aggression.

86
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,554
The Prosecutor.

87
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,810
What brings you here?

88
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,187
Mr.Kammal called me.

89
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,940
Where are the forensics?

90
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,858
They are still asleep.

91
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:37,487
But... does he have confidence in you?

92
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,325
Who covered her face?

93
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,471
It's a professional job.

94
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,516
It's a crime of passion.

95
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:11,020
A girl so beautiful, it's
inevitably passionate.

96
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,189
I have seen it elsewhere.

97
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:14,774
It looks like a singer.

98
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,527
If you aim to be a great detective!

99
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,822
File this and get me some coffee.

100
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:28,162
Someone ordered some mango and...

101
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:29,706
Yeah, over here.

102
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,667
Give it to me.

103
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,587
Bill this on the room.

104
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,672
Thank you. Leave us.

105
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:41,092
What do you want? I'm hungry.

106
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:44,345
I will not feed you. Fend for yourself.
Get out!

107
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:45,805
Yes, sir. Yes...

108
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,137
Salaam alekum. Walekum salaam.

109
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,031
Hello, Mr.Kammal.

110
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,074
How are you? Fine, sir.

111
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,951
How are you, nephew?

112
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,370
And your father?

113
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:10,997
He's okay. Thank you for asking.

114
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,333
Do you have a lead?

115
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,836
The killer is a professional.

116
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,423
Trend with tweezers on this case.

117
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,635
According to my sources, this
is a very delicate case.

118
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:27,722
As you know, some of the her clients...

119
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,642
No I don't know. Who paid for the room?

120
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,190
This is a special type of booking.

121
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:40,652
Only the owner knows who paid.

122
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,195
The owner?

123
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:43,905
Mr.Shafiq.

124
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,247
Take this, sir.

125
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,801
A modest compliment from the hotel.

126
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:17,647
Who discovered the body?

127
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,482
The cleaning maid.

128
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,317
Bring her here.

129
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,278
We let her go early today.

130
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:25,654
Her name?

131
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,158
Salwa. We don't have her last name.

132
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,703
She is Sudanese and paid daily.

133
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:33,246
And her address?

134
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:38,209
In Arba Wa Nuss district. We
don't have the exact address.

135
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,376
You kidding?

136
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,626
Get the head of the neighborhood.

137
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,793
Clinton!

138
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,506
Get over here. Your papers?

139
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,592
Your papers!

140
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,062
You are the head of the neighborhood?

141
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,228
Yes.

142
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,483
We are looking for a certain
Salwa who works at the Hilton.

143
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,776
You know her?

144
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,527
Yes.

145
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,447
Bring her and we will return your papers.

146
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,240
I need it.

147
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:54,077
Enter your hole and close it.

148
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:04,087
I'm learning German.

149
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:06,089
Very ambitious.

150
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,926
Are you aiming for the biggest
fool's tag in the force?

151
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:11,719
I'm already there.

152
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,583
Hello?

153
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,977
Hi, brother. Where are you?

154
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,604
What's up?

155
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,774
You have to take care of dad. I'm tired.

156
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:25,650
I can't.

157
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,735
Scramble to then.

158
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:29,862
Is that a request or an order?

159
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,323
I have to leave. Until when?

160
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,076
Until my return. You kidding?

161
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:14,031
Dad, I received money. We
could go to the hospital.

162
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:18,744
For pity's sake, don't say
you "received" money.

163
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,958
Be honest and admit, you "stole" money.

164
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,085
As you wish.

165
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,505
Dignity can't be bought, my son.

166
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,059
Goodbye.

167
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,206
Do you have Lalena CDs?

168
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,083
"Your love is not enough".

169
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:08,896
This is an illegal copy.

170
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,571
You have reached Club Solitaire.

00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:39,302
* O you, lonely traveler *

176
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,180
* Who passes in front of me *

177
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:47,560
* Why are you leaving me? *

178
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:49,562
* Why do you leave me *

179
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,316
* Alone with my regrets? *

180
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:59,238
* You went away without a word *

181
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:11,600
* My heart has already told you *

182
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,709
* Goodbye *

183
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,290
Salaam walekum. Walekum salaam.

184
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,192
We have a house.
We have a house.

185
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,029
He has a dog. He has a dog.

186
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,492
She has a cat. She has a cat.

187
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,913
James has a parrot.
James has a parrot.

188
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,543
It has a floor. It has a floor.

189
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:50,808
"We are building the future of Cairo".

190
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,672
We had a complaint.

191
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:26,802
Money was stolen from a room.
Did you know anything?

192
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,948
Have you ever ironed shirts?

193
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,163
What's this?

194
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,373
Students who protested?

195
00:21:57,124 --> 00:22:01,212
They distributed leaflets at
the college to incite a revolution.

196
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:04,298
Three days after the
Tunisian President fled...

197
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:05,841
What do you think?

198
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:07,383
We are barely floating,

199
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,513
and you let the Chinese flood the market?

200
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,015
Very patriotic. Kiss my ass!

201
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,475
We're struggling here.

202
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,561
Momo and I, we kill ourselves
to control everything.

203
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,231
If you don't like it,
we could switch areas.

204
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:21,857
Calm down, gentlemen.

205
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:24,527
You're not the only one here.

206
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:25,486
Exactly.

207
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,029
Did we jump you?

208
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:32,243
I want to see sharing again,
but believe me, you will lose.

209
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,204
It's me who decides what to share.

210
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,373
Is that clear? Of course.

211
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,041
Mr.Kammal... Is that clear?

212
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,044
And you, move over.

213
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:47,007
If you don't report, we'll have
to re-assess the situation.

214
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:52,513
Even at the brothel, Tunisia
beats us to football.

215
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,847
It's a shame.

216
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,475
Forget the Hilton.

217
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,311
The Prosecutor labeled it "a suicide".

218
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:00,604
Sorry?

219
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:02,355
A suicide?

220
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:04,400
She slit herself?

221
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:06,819
Congratulations.

222
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:24,503
Don't loiter. You don't
buy, you don't read.

223
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:29,300
I can't read, I look at the pictures.

224
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,971
Give me something for the laundry.

225
00:23:36,223 --> 00:23:37,641
And some chocolate.

226
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,734
Hello. Did Majok call?

227
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:48,693
No.

228
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,405
Here's the chocolate you like.

229
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:54,867
Can anyone read Arabic?

230
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:57,620
Clinton.

231
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:02,499
And apart from this asshole?
Little Mohammed.

232
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:13,218
Shafiq Holding Group.

233
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:17,848
Hatem Shafiq, CEO of Shafiq Holding,

234
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:23,979
leader in construction and
in the cement industry.

235
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:27,358
We are building the future of Cairo...

236
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,202
Which one of you is Hamada Mansour?

237
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,578
They took him away.

238
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,795
Who wants to overthrow the President?

239
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,006
Do you want to say anything?

240
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,634
I'm getting impatient.

241
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,054
I want to get back to the game.

242
00:24:57,554 --> 00:24:58,597
Go on.

243
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,100
You going to spit out his name?

244
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,437
What's his name?

245
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,230
His name.

246
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:20,035
We are starting a major
movement of reconstruction.

247
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,705
This is the first collaboration

248
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:25,749
between public and private sectors.

249
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:28,961
The level of competitiveness
achieved by Egypt

250
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,130
on the international market

251
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:36,051
gives us the means to invest
in our infrastructure

252
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,971
at the level of road networks,

253
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,559
communications, agriculture and water...

254
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,830
This will be the largest
International School in Egypt.

255
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,589
I guarantee you,

256
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:41,218
in a few days, you will
be proud of the results.

257
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,193
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

258
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,779
I have a question, if you allow me.

259
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,949
Did you know this woman?

260
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:11,915
Absolutely not.

261
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:17,212
May I ask you to look again?

262
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,425
Are you sure you've never seen her?

263
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,176
Remind me your name?

264
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:26,263
Commander Noureddine Mostafa.

265
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,764
Noureddine.

266
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:35,022
The Police are supposed protect
honest people, not harass them.

267
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:41,612
Is the car ready? Yes, sir.

268
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,320
Why were the Police looking for you?

269
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,488
I don't know.

270
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:07,823
You don't know?

271
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:10,659
I'm taking you back home.

272
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:11,993
Stop!

273
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:15,414
Someone got murdered at the hotel.

274
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,873
A woman.

275
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,584
I saw the murderer.

276
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,462
I will show you.

277
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,595
This is the man I saw.

278
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:40,147
I told him, $10,000 for a pilgrimage?
That's insane!

279
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:44,234
Are you trying to pull my chain, Egyptian?

280
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:49,614
He said, "It's cheap to find a
pure soul like that of a baby".

281
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:55,579
It was worth it and I prayed for him.

282
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:56,746
God looks over you.

283
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,542
We'll take leave, Chief.

284
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:03,211
Stay back, Nour, I want to talk to you.

285
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,797
What?

286
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:09,009
You went to see Hatem Shafiq?

287
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:14,931
He is related to the murdered singer.

288
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:18,185
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

289
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,854
Didn't I tell you to let it go?

290
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,397
Yes.

291
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:27,277
Nour, you are my nephew,

292
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:30,989
but a simple call from these people and
I can't do anything for you.

293
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,033
He is a friend of the President's son.

294
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:37,662
Look after yourself.

295
00:31:56,973 --> 00:32:00,519
Shafiq has agreed to see me.

296
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:09,444
But... it could be a trap.

297
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:13,657
I will demand for $1 million.

298
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,742
$1 million?

299
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,001
That's way too much. Salwa...

300
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,089
Demand $100,000, keep it small...

301
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,592
If someone gets killed, that would be me.

302
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,595
Don't you trust me?

303
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:40,142
I trust people.

304
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:43,895
We will have to share the money three-ways.

305
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,608
Okay.

306
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:52,278
No problem.

307
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,283
We don't have internet.

308
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,201
I just want Facebook.

309
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,953
That needs the internet.

310
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,081
The internet is on Facebook?
No, the opposite.

311
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,334
What are you confusing me for?
Are you kidding me?

312
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
No sir.

313
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:12,632
Where are you going? Put me
on that fucking Facebook.

314
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,634
I'm looking into it.

315
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:22,934
Gina, the Tunisian singer,
is waiting for you.

316
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,102
Calm down.

317
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,652
Good evening. Good evening.

318
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:40,285
My friend is gone.

319
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:43,121
I don't know where she is.

320
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:47,375
She was to meet someone at the Nile Hilton.

321
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,169
Since then, she is missing.

322
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,512
What's her name?

323
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:01,014
Lalena.

324
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:10,649
The singer?

325
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,406
Who was she meeting?

326
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,825
A friend.

327
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,791
You know something?

328
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,586
Your friend has been killed.

329
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:45,058
She had pictures.

330
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,062
Intimate photos.

331
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,817
I don't want anyone to see them.

332
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,708
How much do you want?

333
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,169
We don't have any photos.

334
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:22,971
$20,000... is all I have.

335
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,394
A lady like you should not be here.

336
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,441
Your name and address, please.

337
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,834
We are done here. Show's over.

338
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,420
Sir.

339
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:56,421
Saleh.

340
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,132
Fadl repaired the satellite
dish, it works like new.

341
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:00,008
Finally!

342
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:03,678
Strange enough, it picks-up
only Italian channels.

343
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,306
What?

344
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:08,350
There will be only Italian channels.

345
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,018
Italian... is good.

346
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,062
Is that your cousin? Yes.

347
00:36:58,608 --> 00:36:59,734
Hello?

348
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,406
Who is this?

349
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:07,492
Commander Noureddine? Yes.

350
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:12,056
Sir.

351
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,685
Where is the men's?

352
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:50,762
Open it.

353
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,519
I was with her that night.

354
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,660
He kept the negatives.

355
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:19,832
He will frame me for murder if I don't pay.

356
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:27,549
He considered himself her owner.

357
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:32,136
His agent, Nagui the Tunisian.

358
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:40,895
You are a member of the Parliament.
You benefit from immunity.

359
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:43,773
Not against the scandal.

360
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,696
The case was closed.

361
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:54,701
I will re-open the investigation.

362
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,496
What do you expect of me?

363
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:07,630
When you came to question me,
I could've broken you, finished you.

364
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,176
I never asked anyone for help,

365
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,139
but I need your now.

366
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,183
I loved her.

367
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:22,812
And she loved me.

368
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:26,524
She wanted me to leave my wife.

369
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:31,070
She was going to get the negatives.

370
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:42,040
How did you know her?

371
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,167
From the Club Solitaire.

372
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:50,882
Wearing gold is forbidden for men.

373
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:55,845
It is said, on the Day of
Judgment, gold becomes hot iron.

374
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,808
But for some, gold is worth the punishment.

375
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,648
Where's the negatives, Amir?

376
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:16,991
A policeman took them.

377
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,286
A policeman?

378
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:22,872
Calm down, Nagui.

379
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,124
I'm telling you the truth.

380
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,558
I believe you, Amir.

381
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:52,276
Love one another, live in harmony.

382
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,783
You will all enter Paradise.

383
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:07,625
Each one of you here,
have a duty to realize

384
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,252
and dedicate your life to it.

385
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,712
Even to yourself,

386
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:14,424
without the entire Muslim brethren,

387
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,511
I swear by God that if you
live for these duties...

388
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:26,352
I pay 180 pounds a day to rent the car.

389
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,355
Give them to me and I
will install the meter.

390
00:42:31,023 --> 00:42:34,026
These rotten people who
govern us, tax us to death

391
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:36,362
and they get treated abroad.

392
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:39,866
We can't even afford cigarettes.

393
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:43,411
But for a gentleman like you...

394
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:52,962
Did you see what they did to
the young man in Alexandria?

395
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:58,050
Those cop fuckers beat him to death.
Did you know?

396
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:01,636
Son of a bitch!

397
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:10,271
The smart guys on the
Internet published photos.

398
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:13,107
There will be a demonstration
on January 25th.

399
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:15,693
On Police Day, to rub it in.

400
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,655
We will show those pigs what
the people think of them.

401
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:22,825
I'm going there.

402
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,161
And you, will you go?

403
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:26,328
There's no choice.

404
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,415
I'm part of the pigs.

405
00:43:33,669 --> 00:43:37,173
The people of Alexandria are
all assholes and myths.

406
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:41,177
This young man was surely a drug addict.
Otherwise, it's impossible.

407
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:44,972
They wouldn't have hit him for no reason.

408
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:51,687
Inspection. Open up.

409
00:43:52,188 --> 00:43:53,188
Welcome.

410
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:56,192
Hi beauty.

411
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:18,965
Look who's here?

412
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:21,759
You're okay?

413
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,010
What an honor!

414
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:26,013
What's up?
It's okay, as you can see.

415
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:30,059
I'm going to sell this shack.
They can put up a mosque.

416
00:44:32,061 --> 00:44:34,522
Do you know what makes
me happy, Noureddine?

417
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:38,776
Tell me, do you know a certain Nagui?

418
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,362
Mac? No, the artistic agent.

419
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:43,739
Artistic?

420
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:49,704
He has two girls working who
think they are artists.

421
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:53,124
They pickup VIPs and he takes pictures.

422
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:56,085
Clic-clac, he snaps. Clic-clac, he snaps.

423
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:59,171
It's his business. He uses an old camera

424
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:02,174
and he makes it more troublesome
with the negatives.

425
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,801
Where can I find him?

426
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,429
He has a club, the club... I forget what.

427
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,307
The Solitaire Club? That's it.

428
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,517
You see, you know everything.

429
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,270
What do you want of him?
I want to sing.

430
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,444
Is there any way to get a drink?
You are at home. C'mon, let's go.

431
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:23,613
Don't worry, I'll pay.

432
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,710
Congratulations, Chief.

433
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:40,713
Bravo! Congratulations.

434
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:42,590
Congratulations.

435
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:47,637
Goodbye.

436
00:45:48,471 --> 00:45:49,513
What is that?

437
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,474
Congratulations, Colonel.

438
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:52,725
Colonel?

439
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:55,853
Go ahead, try it.

440
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,080
You are a genius and I'm an idiot.

441
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,527
What did you get on Shafiq?

442
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:07,531
The singer was his mistress
and he fears a scandal.

443
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,701
He says it was her agent who killed her.

444
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,120
Of course it's him.

445
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,123
The Prosecutor will re-open
the investigation,

446
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,043
he will be released for 100,000 pounds.

447
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:22,463
We will share the rest. Easy money.

448
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,676
You can buy a Peugeot to
replace your metal cage.

449
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:27,842
God willing.

450
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,721
I'm really proud of you.

451
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,684
Thanks to you, we deal directly with VIPs.

452
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:38,270
Soon you will be in this chair.

453
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:45,485
What did you ask?

454
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:51,242
He's OK for $1 million.

455
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:54,704
You are crazy? What if he followed you?

456
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,331
I told you to ask for 100,000.

457
00:46:57,873 --> 00:47:00,543
You will have to share that with us.
Understand?

458
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,515
Good evening. Welcome, sir.

459
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:09,111
* O you, lonely traveler *

460
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,491
* O you, lonely traveler *

461
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,538
* Who passes in front of me *

462
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:24,585
* Why are you leaving me? *

463
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:28,089
* Why do you leave me? *

464
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:31,342
* Alone with my regrets? *

465
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,932
* You went away *

466
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:43,020
* Without a word *

467
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,109
* My heart has already bid you farewell *

468
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,529
* You went away *

469
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:56,534
* Without a word *

470
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:05,501
* My heart has already bid you farewell *

471
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:09,797
* My eyes speak to you *

472
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,800
* Talk to you with tears *

473
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,636
* My eyes speak to you *

474
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,973
* Talk to you with tears *

475
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,603
* O you, lonely traveler *

476
00:49:26,856 --> 00:49:29,525
* Who passes in front of me *

477
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:33,571
* Why do you leave me *

478
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:37,324
* Why do you leave me *

479
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:40,995
* Alone with my regrets? *

480
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,182
Commander, what brings you here?

481
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:04,185
Colonel. I was promoted.

482
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:10,232
Your voice is superb.

483
00:50:12,735 --> 00:50:14,028
I don't drink.

484
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:22,286
Come meet my friends. Hmm?

485
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:24,704
No. No.

486
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,832
Mido!

487
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,959
You were wonderful.

488
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,169
Thank you.

489
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:32,922
Let me introduce you,
my friend, Noureddine.

490
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:35,549
You are one lucky fella.

491
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:37,927
What do you do?

492
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:39,720
Well...

493
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:41,555
He's into ceramic wares.

494
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:44,808
He is the largest manufacturer
in the Middle East.

495
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,311
Noureddine Sanitary ware,
didn't he tell you anything?

496
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:52,858
You must have pissed in it, some day.

497
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:59,490
Tell them about the golden toilets
you made for the President.

498
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:04,703
My darling, we avoid revealing
the privacy of our customers.

499
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:23,324
Do you like the view?

500
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:28,871
I work tomorrow.

501
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,549
Did Lalena tell you about her affair
with a very influential man?

502
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:45,220
She said she was in love.

503
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:54,188
Do you know Nagui the Tunisian?

504
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:57,483
Come in.

505
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:05,115
Go wait for me upstairs.

506
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,300
We suspect a certain Nagui,

507
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:12,302
Nagui the Tunisian,

508
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:14,096
who might've killed your friend.

509
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,985
What do you want from me?

510
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:31,780
Do you want to put me in danger?

511
00:56:32,948 --> 00:56:34,116
Are you in danger?

512
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:38,245
No.

513
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:41,123
I don't know him.

514
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:59,182
Tell me, why did you leave your country?

515
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:04,896
I wanted to chase my dreams.

516
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:10,902
I'm an artist.

517
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:16,199
But people who have money

518
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,537
want to buy and lock me in a golden cage.

519
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:26,752
Even if you have the
key, you can't run away.

520
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:35,594
And you?

521
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:42,100
Your thing, is it the money or...?

522
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,656
Can I see you again?

523
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:06,833
Realize.

524
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,087
Realize?

525
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:16,343
Realize.

526
00:58:17,803 --> 00:58:19,096
Okay. Realize.

527
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,766
Realize.

528
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,246
Do you know the time?

529
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,841
Salwa!

530
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,094
Salwa!

531
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:01,304
The Police are here for you.

532
00:59:02,097 --> 00:59:03,765
Salwa, come here.

533
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:12,899
Hold on.

534
00:59:21,616 --> 00:59:23,618
I'll say you're not here.

535
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,634
Get moving! Hurry up.

536
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:29,095
What's going on, Ali?

537
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:32,015
Reinforcements are being
sent to Arba Wa Nuss.

538
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,851
Apparently, a Policeman
killed two Sudanese.

539
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:38,438
The neighborhood Chief and a girl.

540
01:02:38,605 --> 01:02:40,899
You kidding?
It's good, we manage.

541
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:49,324
Yes, Nour?

542
01:02:49,491 --> 01:02:51,701
The maid was killed.

543
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,079
From the Hilton. Are you sure?

544
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:56,623
It's my fault.

545
01:02:56,957 --> 01:03:00,669
Don't worry. Do you want
me to take care of it?

546
01:03:00,835 --> 01:03:01,920
It's not worth it.

547
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:03,588
I know where to find Nagui.

548
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,145
Call Ms.Gina.

549
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:20,730
She's not here.

550
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:23,775
I'm telling you to call her!

551
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:40,959
He's my bodyguard.

552
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,011
Nagui, get out of there!

553
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,805
Get out or I shoot!

554
01:04:01,396 --> 01:04:02,564
Nagui!

555
01:07:41,407 --> 01:07:42,575
Noureddine?

556
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:46,996
Calm down, Noureddine. You are angry?

557
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:48,164
Move.

558
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,458
Gently.

559
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:05,556
Salaam Alekum Shut your mouth.

560
01:08:07,058 --> 01:08:08,851
Who are you, asshole?

561
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,981
Colonel Noureddine Mostafa.

562
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:13,898
Colonel?

563
01:08:14,065 --> 01:08:15,065
Yes.

564
01:08:15,149 --> 01:08:16,359
What Police station?

565
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,736
Qasr Al-Nil.

566
01:08:20,655 --> 01:08:22,115
Qasr Al-Nil between my two's!

567
01:08:22,282 --> 01:08:23,866
You're not in Qasr Al-Nil.

568
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:30,456
This man is accused of murder.

569
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:34,794
With all due respect, Colonel,
I'm the one here who decides

570
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:36,754
who is guilty or and who is not?

571
01:08:37,672 --> 01:08:39,090
Well said, Mr.Khalil. Well said.

572
01:08:40,174 --> 01:08:45,221
You, stay where you are.
You shit of a junkie.

573
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,600
Why do you let this fag hit me?

574
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:51,811
Shut your mouth. Do we know each other?

575
01:08:52,353 --> 01:08:53,855
Have we met before?

576
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:56,607
My apologies, Colonel.

577
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,662
That's not fair, Mr.Khalil.
I pay you more than that.

578
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,249
Son of a bitch. You take me corrupt?

579
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,335
Never, Mr.Khalil, ever.

580
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:20,089
Do you have a lawyer?

581
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:27,180
Kill me, let's finish it.

582
01:09:28,014 --> 01:09:29,974
I swear I will not denounce you.

583
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,768
As you wish.

584
01:09:32,477 --> 01:09:34,062
Empty your pockets.

585
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:01,671
This too.

586
01:10:10,223 --> 01:10:11,557
I have nothing more.

587
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,491
Did he want a lawyer?
He refused.

588
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:35,415
This is not an hour to interrogate people.

589
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:37,583
I didn't even have breakfast.

590
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:39,544
Shafiq's photos.

591
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:42,839
You don't have them?

592
01:10:43,589 --> 01:10:45,758
Lalena stole them from you, right?

593
01:10:45,925 --> 01:10:49,303
Mr.Policeman did his job well!

594
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:53,141
Do you think you're doing
a real investigation?

595
01:10:53,307 --> 01:10:55,893
Watch your tongue or I cut it out.

596
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:00,106
Where were you the night of the murder?

597
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:02,942
With Gina. Can she confirm this?

598
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,486
If she lives again.

599
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:12,076
You are suspected in Lalena's murder.

600
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:16,581
You will be in custody for 15 days.

601
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,715
Momo!

602
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:27,757
What?

603
01:11:29,302 --> 01:11:31,888
Watch him, but be careful. He's a snake.

604
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,054
Where are you going?

605
01:12:13,304 --> 01:12:14,931
Where's he? I don't know.

606
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,183
Where's he? I don't know.

607
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:21,020
Wake up.

608
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:28,069
Stand.

609
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:42,458
Very well, sir.

610
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,545
I will talk to the personnel department.

611
01:12:46,045 --> 01:12:48,005
Can I have his file?

612
01:12:48,172 --> 01:12:49,465
Where's Momo?

613
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,469
State Security wants to see you.
What do you have?

614
01:12:54,178 --> 01:12:55,178
Nagui is dead.

615
01:12:56,013 --> 01:12:58,432
Don't worry, it's not a problem.

616
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:01,394
Tell me what you are going
to say to State Security.

617
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,189
There's nothing to say.
You will go in uniform.

618
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:06,357
Is that all?

619
01:13:06,732 --> 01:13:10,486
If they sniff the money,
they will want their share.

620
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,823
I'll hide the Mercedes at my cousin's.

621
01:13:17,577 --> 01:13:19,579
I couldn't do anything about it.
I was ordered.

622
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:21,122
Listen to me, Chief.

623
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:23,291
You take me for a clown?

624
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,586
I should've never trusted you!

625
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,021
Colonel Noureddine.

626
01:13:47,398 --> 01:13:49,400
State Security summoned me.

627
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,527
What can I do?

628
01:13:57,992 --> 01:14:00,077
Where's Gina? Be careful.

629
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:02,121
Where's she? Keep it down.

630
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:04,873
Nagui is dead.

631
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:12,048
Did he have the photos?

632
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:14,175
No.

633
01:14:19,805 --> 01:14:21,557
You are a good man.

634
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:24,226
You are doing a good job.

635
01:15:06,894 --> 01:15:08,062
Sit.

636
01:15:14,902 --> 01:15:17,238
Your name appeared in our files.

637
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,450
Do you know that singer Gina?

638
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:22,617
No.

639
01:15:23,703 --> 01:15:25,996
We found her dead 2 hours ago.

640
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,126
Sowed and thrown on a pile of garbage.

641
01:15:58,404 --> 01:16:00,531
Is Kammal Mostafa your uncle?

642
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:03,033
We have our suspicions about him.

643
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:05,536
Have you noticed anything lately?

644
01:16:05,703 --> 01:16:06,703
No.

645
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,504
Two Sudanese were killed.

646
01:16:16,881 --> 01:16:21,427
One worked at the Hilton and
witnessed the murder there.

647
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:23,929
You met her?

648
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:26,432
I searched for her, without success.

649
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:29,685
What is your relationship
with Hatem Shafiq?

650
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,520
Nothing.

651
01:16:35,566 --> 01:16:37,735
Mr.Shafiq is a member of the Parliament.

652
01:16:38,277 --> 01:16:41,155
Any investigation involving
him is our responsibility.

653
01:16:47,661 --> 01:16:48,829
Dismissed.

654
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:35,125
Welcome, Sir.

655
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:36,292
By the way,

656
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:38,547
the technician came by and
the dish is working fine.

657
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:43,759
You have all Europe, God forgive
me, with the naughty girls.

658
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:45,469
Noureddine!

659
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:55,271
Saleh!

660
01:17:57,982 --> 01:17:59,149
Wake up!

661
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,693
Saleh!

662
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,437
Hey, you!

663
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:38,105
Where are you going?

664
01:18:38,272 --> 01:18:39,481
Move, bitch.

665
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:49,617
Stop!

666
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:51,452
What is this?

667
01:18:52,202 --> 01:18:54,163
I can't take them into custody.

668
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,750
By whose order? There's
a bus to Sudan outside.

669
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,252
This place, here is for Egyptians only.

670
01:19:00,419 --> 01:19:02,713
I will have to report
this to the Brigadier.

671
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:03,923
So be it.

672
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:09,261
Sir, I saw what happened at the Hilton.

673
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,186
Let these kids out and clear up.

674
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,437
Momo! Yes?

675
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,731
We have the Hilton's maid.

676
01:19:20,898 --> 01:19:22,650
Call the Prosecutor.

677
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,401
Okay.

678
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:31,700
There's no answer.

679
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:32,868
Be persistent.

680
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:34,662
Yes, sir.

681
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,455
I'll try again.

682
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:47,299
I have something important to show you.

683
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:48,759
At your service.

684
01:19:58,894 --> 01:19:59,937
Ali?

685
01:20:00,187 --> 01:20:01,897
We are in operation mode.

686
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:20,749
You. Come.

687
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,876
Don't be afraid.

688
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,050
I have Salwa, the maid from the hotel.

689
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:33,762
With me, in the car.

690
01:20:34,513 --> 01:20:37,766
Youssef put her in a
cell, but I got her out.

691
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:55,242
She was arrested in Tahrir Square.

692
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:57,703
And you bring her to me in a Police car?

693
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,205
She is the only witness. I thought...

694
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:04,376
You tell Mr.Kammal that I
ordered you to release her.

695
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:07,546
And tell him that Shafiq
is trying to kill me.

696
01:21:07,713 --> 01:21:09,715
Speak only to Mr.Kammal.

697
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:15,429
Salwa.

698
01:21:17,723 --> 01:21:19,308
Don't be afraid.

699
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,435
Come with me.

700
01:21:40,245 --> 01:21:41,663
You are tired?

701
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:46,502
You are hungry?

702
01:22:42,307 --> 01:22:44,476
You know that I love you like a brother.

703
01:22:47,771 --> 01:22:48,897
So?

704
01:22:49,356 --> 01:22:51,275
Do you want to say something?

705
01:23:29,563 --> 01:23:31,398
What did you see exactly?

706
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:41,617
I saw Shafiq come out of the room.

707
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:45,370
He put his watch back on.

708
01:23:47,206 --> 01:23:51,251
I heard a woman in the room, who said:

709
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,712
You promised me.

710
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,799
He took the elevator and left.

711
01:23:58,675 --> 01:24:01,261
I went back to work.

712
01:24:03,889 --> 01:24:06,600
A little later, I heard screams.

713
01:24:09,311 --> 01:24:12,022
Another man came out of the room.

714
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:17,569
How long was that after Shafiq left?

715
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,613
Not long.

716
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:25,035
I was in the hall next door.

717
01:24:37,047 --> 01:24:41,176
He is the same man who came to Clinton.

718
01:24:45,097 --> 01:24:47,140
Shafiq thinks you are dead.

719
01:24:48,141 --> 01:24:50,269
He is after me now.

720
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:29,016
Why are you here, officer?

721
01:25:29,182 --> 01:25:32,144
I'm here to see Mr.Shafiq.
And it's Colonel Noureddine.

722
01:25:32,311 --> 01:25:33,979
Mr.Shafiq is playing golf.

723
01:25:34,146 --> 01:25:35,564
Tell him it's urgent.

724
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:40,277
I'm sorry, sir. You need an invitation.

725
01:25:40,444 --> 01:25:42,404
Does he want to see her?
That's my invitation.

726
01:26:53,225 --> 01:26:55,185
Sorry to disturb you.

727
01:26:55,936 --> 01:26:57,771
Can we talk in private?

728
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,024
We are at the 11th hole. Can it wait?

729
01:27:01,191 --> 01:27:02,651
Unfortunately no.

730
01:27:10,617 --> 01:27:13,745
Lalena had the receipt for the
photos when she was killed.

731
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:15,705
I have the photos.

732
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:17,582
And the negatives.

733
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:20,460
And a witness.

734
01:27:38,395 --> 01:27:40,439
Excuse me, gentlemen.

735
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:51,533
I thought you were clever.

736
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,245
In reality, you are an idiot.

737
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,373
A fucking idiot.

738
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:01,168
Do you believe in Utopia?

739
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:04,629
Justice does not exist here.

740
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,927
What is this? What are you doing?

741
01:28:11,094 --> 01:28:12,679
Come, Mr.Shafiq.

742
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:16,016
No. I want my lawyer.

743
01:28:16,183 --> 01:28:18,018
Sit in my office.

744
01:28:18,185 --> 01:28:19,811
My lawyer, I said.

745
01:28:21,646 --> 01:28:24,566
They are in force. We are double barreled.

746
01:28:32,491 --> 01:28:34,576
Have you been treated well, Mr.Shafiq?

747
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:40,165
You are guilty of kidnapping a Deputy.

748
01:28:40,332 --> 01:28:43,376
Calm down. My nephew has made a mistake,

749
01:28:43,543 --> 01:28:45,962
we can talk like civilized people.

750
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:49,716
Who is the Prosecutor?
Me, sir. Hello.

751
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,094
Do you realize the
magnitude of your mistake?

752
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:02,979
Yes, sir?

753
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:06,607
Yes, sir?

754
01:29:09,569 --> 01:29:10,569
Yes, sir.

755
01:29:11,655 --> 01:29:13,114
Very well, sir.

756
01:29:14,366 --> 01:29:15,659
Very well, sir.

757
01:29:16,243 --> 01:29:17,536
Good bye, sir.

758
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:19,496
Goodbye.

759
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:29,798
The Attorney General has ordered
the arrest of Hatem Shafiq

760
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,176
for the murder of Lalena at the hotel.

761
01:29:40,892 --> 01:29:44,020
Send my wife and children to Dubai.

762
01:29:44,187 --> 01:29:45,230
Very well, sir.

763
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:47,983
Keep all the documents safe.

764
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:53,947
You saw me?

765
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,118
You know I didn't kill her.

766
01:29:59,286 --> 01:30:00,704
You know it, right?

767
01:30:02,289 --> 01:30:03,707
I loved her.

768
01:30:34,696 --> 01:30:35,822
Your room is over there.

769
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:49,127
She your wife?

770
01:30:50,003 --> 01:30:51,212
She is beautiful.

771
01:30:53,506 --> 01:30:54,674
Where's she?

772
01:30:57,927 --> 01:30:59,012
Killed in a car crash.

773
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:29,167
Shafiq didn't kill that woman.

774
01:31:30,377 --> 01:31:32,253
He said he loved her.

775
01:31:36,549 --> 01:31:37,884
What's that?

776
01:31:42,055 --> 01:31:43,306
Stamps.

777
01:31:47,686 --> 01:31:49,229
Stamps for what?

778
01:31:49,396 --> 01:31:51,147
To empty my head.

779
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:49,998
Qasr Al-Nil, are you receiving me?

780
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:51,207
Yes, sir.

781
01:32:51,374 --> 01:32:54,085
Order from the Ministry: Open fire.

782
01:32:55,044 --> 01:32:56,171
Received.

783
01:32:56,796 --> 01:32:58,173
We have the orders.

784
01:32:58,381 --> 01:32:59,841
Open fire.

785
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:01,092
On who?

786
01:33:01,259 --> 01:33:02,635
On them, Youssef!

787
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:04,304
Execute.

788
01:33:18,735 --> 01:33:19,903
Kammal! Kammal!

789
01:33:49,516 --> 01:33:52,018
Tahrir Square, Cairo,

790
01:33:52,185 --> 01:33:56,147
the number of protesters
is estimated to be 10,000.

791
01:33:56,314 --> 01:33:58,691
Stone throwers targeted

792
01:33:58,858 --> 01:34:01,861
the security forces in Qasr Al-Aini street,

793
01:34:02,028 --> 01:34:03,947
adjacent to Tahrir Square.

794
01:34:04,113 --> 01:34:09,911
Some isolated rioters
attacked public facilities.

795
01:34:11,913 --> 01:34:13,039
Mr.Kammal!

796
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:15,500
I'm waiting for you.

797
01:34:15,667 --> 01:34:18,086
No, Youssef, go for it!

798
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:19,796
What?

799
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:23,967
Power to the people! Down
with the military regime!

800
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:30,431
From what was stated by the
Commander-in-Chief Of Army,

801
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:34,811
a curfew is imminent.

802
01:34:35,812 --> 01:34:39,649
What is the situation on the street?

803
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:42,405
The urgency for the citizens, right now,

804
01:34:42,495 --> 01:34:48,825
is to ensure their needs
with bread, fruit and water.

805
01:34:48,992 --> 01:34:55,248
The ordinary citizen puts his wife and
children before thinking anything.

806
01:34:55,415 --> 01:34:57,500
Good. We are live...

807
01:34:58,376 --> 01:34:59,376
Uncle?

808
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,797
The situation seems to have calmed down...

809
01:35:03,756 --> 01:35:04,756
Uncle?

810
01:35:05,758 --> 01:35:10,722
The populace complies with the orders
of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army,

811
01:35:10,889 --> 01:35:13,808
President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak.

812
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:21,107
Curfew will take effect from 6:00 PM
following the incident...

813
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:44,756
Is there anyone?

814
01:35:47,008 --> 01:35:48,008
Is there anyone?

815
01:35:48,134 --> 01:35:49,218
Hey!

816
01:35:49,385 --> 01:35:50,637
Coming. Coming.

817
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:56,809
Three packs of Cleopatra.

818
01:35:58,603 --> 01:35:59,603
There.

819
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:30,343
Salwa!

820
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:45,149
Where are you going?

821
01:36:45,358 --> 01:36:47,568
You are the only one who knows the truth!

822
01:36:49,278 --> 01:36:52,699
The man you just shot,
did you see him before?

823
01:36:53,783 --> 01:36:54,951
At the Hilton?

824
01:37:12,844 --> 01:37:13,928
Here.

825
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:19,434
Go away.

826
01:37:20,018 --> 01:37:22,937
Leave this country. You
have no future here.

827
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:36,743
Police! Go back. Inside!

828
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:46,836
State Security.

829
01:38:10,943 --> 01:38:12,028
Uncle? Uncle?

830
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:14,988
Where are you?

831
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:17,844
Where's Mr.Kammal?

832
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:20,221
Mr.Kammal!

833
01:39:21,556 --> 01:39:22,765
Goodbye.

834
01:39:26,978 --> 01:39:27,978
Let's go.

835
01:39:40,283 --> 01:39:42,368
You let him go? You let him go?

836
01:39:42,785 --> 01:39:44,495
We have our money, right?

837
01:39:44,662 --> 01:39:46,581
We don't have the proof that he killed her.

838
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:49,750
No. He just fell in love with a bad girl.

839
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:51,627
That's good, we have the money.

840
01:40:13,149 --> 01:40:14,984
Why did you let him go?

841
01:40:18,863 --> 01:40:19,655
Why?

842
01:40:19,822 --> 01:40:23,242
Relax a bit. It's over, we have our money.

843
01:40:26,037 --> 01:40:29,081
I have a corpse in my car. The murderer.

844
01:40:29,582 --> 01:40:31,500
He is an officer of State Security.

845
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:53,916
In a day or two, this mess will be over.

846
01:41:54,959 --> 01:41:58,838
The President will involve the
army, and who will he want?

847
01:41:59,005 --> 01:42:00,464
Us!

848
01:42:01,966 --> 01:42:04,593
Are you involved in the murder of Lalena?

849
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:08,806
Bloody heartburn. I need to eat.

850
01:42:09,849 --> 01:42:11,267
You killed her?

851
01:42:11,434 --> 01:42:14,353
What are you talking about? Of course not.

852
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:19,108
I knew about the Nagui business.

853
01:42:19,942 --> 01:42:21,861
I knew what he was doing.

854
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:25,740
He trapped businessmen with his girls.

855
01:42:26,324 --> 01:42:29,910
I got a percentage. Made me a lot of money.

856
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:34,165
But with the photos of
Shafiq, it got complicated.

857
01:42:34,874 --> 01:42:37,168
State Security contacted me.

858
01:42:37,668 --> 01:42:41,005
I thought we had gone too far.

859
01:42:41,964 --> 01:42:45,301
Except that they actually
wanted their piece of the pie.

860
01:42:46,218 --> 01:42:48,763
They made a real carnage.

861
01:42:50,056 --> 01:42:52,975
Poor little girl. She died for nothing.

862
01:42:55,186 --> 01:42:57,980
That's life. May she rest in peace.

863
01:42:58,564 --> 01:42:59,940
What do you want to do there?

864
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:15,748
We are always live to
describe the situation

865
01:43:15,915 --> 01:43:20,252
in the streets of Cairo, and
especially in the city center...

866
01:43:20,503 --> 01:43:21,587
Nur...

867
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:23,422
Are you not OK?

868
01:43:24,715 --> 01:43:26,092
What did you have?

869
01:43:28,803 --> 01:43:30,471
Don't feel good?

870
01:43:31,931 --> 01:43:33,516
You killed Gina too.

871
01:43:42,691 --> 01:43:45,194
Get out of the bad mood.

872
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,518
Have you gone mad?

873
01:45:00,102 --> 01:45:01,604
Do you want to kill me?

874
01:45:02,313 --> 01:45:04,315
I treated you like a son.

875
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:07,526
Shame on you!

876
01:45:08,444 --> 01:45:10,613
Very good. Do you want to kill me?

877
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:12,990
Kill me, sir.

878
01:45:13,157 --> 01:45:14,157
Kill me!

879
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,534
He has a revolver!

880
01:45:42,686 --> 01:45:43,686
Stop!

881
01:45:45,314 --> 01:45:47,733
That's enough! We are not like them!

882
01:45:57,451 --> 01:46:00,079
Freedom! Freedom!
